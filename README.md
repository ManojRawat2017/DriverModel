# DriverModel
Similar to pre-churn prediction model, but with scorecard for telemetry drivers of unhappy customers.

DriverModel.py is a script to transfer the entire process of making this model from the JupyterNotebook file and make it executable in DSVM.

## Notebooks:
* Fall2019 - Overall model on EU data
* SingleSeat - Application of model to Single Seat tenants within Admin
